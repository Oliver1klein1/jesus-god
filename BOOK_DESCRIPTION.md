# Book Description: "Framing Jesus — How Ancient Bible Changes Elevated Jesus Beyond Our Reach"

---

## PRIMARY BOOK DESCRIPTION (Amazon/Back Cover - 250 words)

**Have you ever felt that uncomfortable twinge when reading Jesus's own words?**

*"The Father is greater than I."*  
*"Why call me good? Only God is good."*  
*"You, Father, are the only true God."*

These aren't obscure verses hidden in footnotes. They're Jesus's direct statements—yet they read like forbidden text in today's Christian landscape. For years, you've probably brushed past them with a mental shrug, assuming they fit somehow into the Trinity doctrine you were taught.

**But what if they don't fit because they weren't supposed to?**

In this groundbreaking investigation, you'll discover documented evidence that the Jesus of history may be radically different from the Christ of creeds. Through careful examination of ancient manuscripts, early Church Father quotations, and patristic testimonies, a disturbing pattern emerges: **Whenever Jesus subordinated himself to the Father, later scribes found ways—sometimes subtle, sometimes surgical—to edit those passages out of existence.**

You'll encounter:

- **Bishop Irenaeus** quoting a verse from Luke that simply vanished from all modern Bibles
- **The Syriac Sinaiticus** (preserving text traditions from 160 CE) reading "Joseph begat Jesus"—no virgin birth
- **Codex Bezae** preserving Jesus's baptism with "Today I have begotten you"—erased from later manuscripts
- **Six independent witnesses** quoting Jesus identifying "the Father as Creator of all"—words that disappeared as Jesus was elevated to co-Creator
- **Gregory of Nyssa** openly admitting Trinitarian theology required rejecting "Jewish dogma" about God

**This isn't conspiracy theory. This is documented textual history.**

But here's what makes this investigation truly radical: **By discovering what was changed, you recover what was lost**—Jesus's empowering message about the Father and about your own divine potential. 

The truth won't destroy your faith. It might finally set it free.

*Part of the "Rediscovering Jesus' Subverted Teachings and The Father's Love" Series*

## EXTENDED DESCRIPTION (Website/Detailed - 500 words)

### **What if everything you thought you knew about Jesus is based on edited texts?**

You've probably heard the Trinity explained a hundred different ways. You've been told Jesus is "fully God and fully man"—a mystery you're supposed to accept without understanding. You've sung worship songs declaring Jesus as Creator of the universe.

But Jesus himself said something very different.

**"The Father is greater than I."** (John 14:28)  
**"Why call me good? Only God is good."** (Mark 10:18)  
**"Father... you are the only true God."** (John 17:3)

These aren't marginal verses. They're Jesus's direct testimony about his relationship to the Father. Yet modern Christianity has developed elaborate theological frameworks to explain them away, neutralize them, or reinterpret them to fit doctrines Jesus never taught.

### **The Investigation Begins**

In 1903, scholar Allan Hoben discovered something that would change everything: Bishop Irenaeus (c. 180 CE) quoted Luke's Gospel saying **"the Father is the Creator of all"**—a verse that doesn't exist in any modern Bible.

One missing verse might be explained away. But what Hoben uncovered was just the beginning.

### **What You'll Discover**

This book takes you on a forensic journey through:

**Ancient Manuscripts** that preserve radically different readings:
- The Syriac Sinaiticus (160-170 CE text tradition) reading "Joseph begat Jesus"
- Codex Bezae preserving "Today I have begotten you" at Jesus's baptism
- Progressive editorial stages showing virgin birth added later

**Church Father Testimonies** preserving what was lost:
- Six independent witnesses (Justin Martyr, Irenaeus, Clement, Tertullian, and others) quoting Jesus identifying "the Father as Creator of all"
- Tertullian stating Christians believed Jesus was "begotten of God the Father at the river Jordan"
- Early Christianity's adoptionist beliefs documented and then erased

**Theological Evolution** traced through evidence:
- How beliefs about Jesus moved backward in time (from exalted at resurrection → adopted at baptism → divine from birth → pre-existent before creation)
- Why Paul's cosmic Christ ultimately overwrote Jesus's own subordinate self-description
- How the Council of Nicaea (325 CE) enforced through imperial power what couldn't be won through Scripture
- Gregory of Nyssa's shocking admission that Trinity required overthrowing "Jewish dogma"

### **What Makes This Different**

This isn't another academic treatise that loses readers in technical jargon. Neither is it shallow conspiracy theory that lacks scholarly grounding.

Instead, you'll find:
- **Accessible scholarship** that respects your intelligence without requiring a theology degree
- **Visual evidence** through professional presentation of manuscript comparisons and witness testimonies  
- **Emotional honesty** as the author shares his own journey through doubt, fear, and discovery
- **Balanced tone** that questions doctrine without attacking faith
- **Empowering message** about recovering Jesus's original teaching on human divine potential

### **Who This Book Is For**

You'll find this book invaluable if you:
- Notice biblical contradictions but feel guilty questioning them
- Struggle to explain Trinity in ways that make logical sense
- Feel Jesus's achievements are forever beyond your reach because "he was God"
- Want intellectual honesty without abandoning spiritual connection
- Seek evidence-based understanding of Christian origins
- Wonder if Jesus's real message got obscured by later theology
- Need scholarly support for progressive/non-traditional Christian views
- Are ready to follow truth wherever it leads—even if it challenges two thousand years of tradition

### **What You'll Gain**

By the final page, you'll:
- **Understand** how and why biblical texts were changed over centuries
- **Recognize** the pattern of Jesus's progressive elevation from devoted Son to co-equal God
- **Possess** documented evidence from manuscripts and Church Fathers
- **Recover** Jesus's Father-centered teachings about divine access and human potential
- **Navigate** the choice between accepting theological evolution or returning to Jesus's original message
- **Feel equipped** to discuss these findings thoughtfully with others
- **Experience** intellectual freedom while maintaining spiritual connection

### **The Deeper Journey**

This investigation isn't just about what was changed—it's about **what was lost and can be recovered**.

When Jesus said, "The one who believes in me will do the works I do, and greater works than these" (John 14:12), was he speaking as God to mere mortals? Or as a fully human son of the Father showing us the path to our own divine potential?

The answer depends on which Jesus you're reading about: the historical teacher who pointed to his Father, or the theological construction who became the Father's equal.

**This book gives you the evidence to decide for yourself.**

*Followed by "Reality Unveiled: How Jesus Revealed You Are More Powerful Than You Ever Imagined" for practical application of these recovered teachings.*
