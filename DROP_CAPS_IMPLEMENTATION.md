## VISUAL EFFECT

**Drop caps create:**

1. ✓ **Professional literary aesthetic** - Elevates perceived quality
2. ✓ **Clear entry point** - Signals where main content begins
3. ✓ **Visual interest** - Breaks up text density
4. ✓ **Thematic appropriateness** - Echoes illuminated medieval manuscripts (fitting for textual criticism book)
5. ✓ **Consistent branding** - Blue color ties to overall design scheme
6. ✓ **Enhanced readability** - Draws eye to beginning of each chapter

---

## IMPLEMENTATION STRATEGY

**Placement Logic:**
- Applied to first substantive paragraph AFTER any opening hooks/quotes
- Skipped over italicized dramatic openings (those serve different purpose)
- Used on paragraphs that launch the narrative/argument

**Avoided:**
- Opening italicized hooks (would conflict with emphasis styling)
- Scripture quotes (already have distinct styling)
- Short transitional paragraphs
