# FINAL BOOK DESCRIPTION
## "Framing Jesus — How Ancient Bible Changes Elevated Jesus Beyond Our Reach"

---

## PRIMARY BOOK DESCRIPTION (Goal-Directed, Reader-Benefit Focused)

### **You've Been Reading An Edited Version**

**That uncomfortable feeling when you read these verses? Trust it.**

*"Father... you are the only true God."* — Jesus (John 17:3)  
*"The Father is greater than I."* — Jesus (John 14:28)  
*"Why call me good? Only God is good."* — Jesus (Mark 10:18)

For years, you've probably brushed past these statements, assuming they somehow fit the Trinity doctrine you were taught. The mental gymnastics required to reconcile them never quite sat right, but questioning felt dangerous—like pulling a thread that might unravel everything.

**What if those contradictions aren't bugs in your understanding—but clues to what was changed?**

### **The Evidence You've Been Waiting For**

This book gives you what years of Sunday school never did: **documented proof** from ancient manuscripts and Church Father writings showing exactly what was altered, when, and why.

You'll finally understand why:

**The verse Bishop Irenaeus quoted in 180 CE doesn't exist in any modern Bible.** He cited Luke saying "the Father is the Creator of all" with complete confidence his readers could verify it. Search your Bible today—it's gone. Deleted. As if Jesus never said it.

**Six early Church Fathers independently quote Jesus identifying "the Father as Creator of all."** Justin Martyr, Clement of Alexandria, Irenaeus, Tertullian—separated by geography, theology, and time. All preserve the same Father-Creator formula. All missing from modern manuscripts. The pattern isn't coincidence.

**The oldest manuscript tradition of Matthew reads "Joseph begat Jesus."** When Scottish scholar Agnes Smith Lewis examined the Syriac Sinaiticus in 1892—preserving text from approximately 160 CE—she found no virgin birth, no miraculous conception. Just biological father and son.

**Ancient manuscripts preserve a radically different baptism scene.** Codex Bezae and multiple Church Fathers quote the voice from heaven declaring: *"You are my Son; TODAY I have begotten you"*—directly stating Jesus BECAME God's Son at that moment. Later scribes changed it to the safer "with you I am well pleased," erasing the explosive implication of divine adoption.

This isn't speculation. This is what the manuscripts show when you line them up chronologically.

### **What You'll Gain (And Why It Matters)**

**If you're exhausted from:**
- Pretending Bible contradictions don't bother you
- Accepting "it's a mystery" for doctrines that make no logical sense
- Feeling intellectually dishonest about what you've been taught
- Watching church leaders dodge uncomfortable questions
- Believing Jesus's achievements are forever beyond your reach because "he was God"

**This book offers:**

✓ **Intellectual Freedom** — Permission to question backed by scholarly evidence  
✓ **Validated Intuition** — Your suspicions were correct; the contradictions ARE real  
✓ **Historical Truth** — What early Christians actually believed before councils and creeds  
✓ **Recovered Access** — Jesus's original teaching about direct Father-connection  
✓ **Empowering Message** — Discover what Jesus said about YOUR divine potential  
✓ **Mental Relief** — Finally, theology that makes SENSE  
✓ **Conversation Tools** — Evidence for thoughtful discussions without alienating others  

### **The Journey You'll Take**

**Part I: When the Father Alone Was God**  
Discover how six independent witnesses preserve Jesus's words that vanished from Scripture. Trace Marcion's infamous editing and the orthodox response that ironically achieved the same result.

**Part II: The Counter-Move: Elevating the Son**  
Watch Paul's cosmic Christ theology clash with Jesus's own humble words. See how "good teacher" passages and Father-Creator statements were progressively softened or deleted.

**Part III: Genealogies, Virgins & Begotten Sons**  
Examine manuscript evidence for late-arriving virgin birth narratives. Understand why genealogies contradict and how baptism declarations were changed from "today I have begotten you" to "I am well pleased."

**Part IV: Trinity on Trial**  
Witness Emperor Constantine enforcing theology through political power at Nicaea. Read Gregory of Nyssa's shocking admission that Trinity required overthrowing "Jewish dogma"—the very monotheism Jesus himself proclaimed.

### **The Question Only You Can Answer**

By the final page, you'll face a choice:

**Accept the theological evolution** as legitimate development guided by the Holy Spirit—even though it contradicts Jesus's own understanding of God.

**Or return to Jesus's original teaching**—recovering his Father-centered message about divine access and human potential that two thousand years of doctrine have obscured.

**Either way, you'll make that choice with open eyes**, equipped with manuscript evidence, patristic citations, and scholarly analysis. No more guessing. No more guilty doubts. No more pretending the contradictions aren't there.

### **What Makes This Investigation Different**

This isn't another academic treatise drowning in footnotes that only scholars can parse. Neither is it shallow conspiracy theory lacking scholarly rigor.

Instead, you'll find:

**Accessible Scholarship** — Academic evidence presented in conversational, engaging narrative that respects your intelligence without requiring a theology degree.

**Visual Evidence** — Professional cards, manuscript comparisons, and timeline graphics make complex textual criticism digestible and memorable.

**Emotional Safety** — The author shares his own journey through doubt and fear, modeling how to question honestly while maintaining spiritual connection.

**Balanced Approach** — Challenges orthodox theology without attacking Jesus. Questions creeds without dismissing faith. Examines evidence without cynicism.

**Empowering Conclusion** — Not just deconstruction, but reconstruction around Jesus's actual Father-centered teaching and what it reveals about your own divine capacity.

### **The Promise**

**You can love Jesus, honor truth, maintain spiritual connection, AND understand what actually happened historically.**

You don't have to choose between intellectual honesty and faith. Between questioning doctrine and losing Jesus. Between accepting contradictions and abandoning Scripture.

This book proves you can have all of it—**truth, Jesus, spiritual depth, and intellectual integrity**—by following the manuscript evidence to recover what was changed and why.

### **Who Should Read This**

This book is for you if:

- ✓ You notice Bible contradictions but feel guilty questioning them
- ✓ You've been told "just accept the mystery" about Trinity and it's never satisfied your mind
- ✓ You wonder if Jesus's achievements are beyond your reach because "he was God and you're not"
- ✓ You want evidence-based understanding, not blind faith or cynical rejection
- ✓ You're ready to discover what six Church Fathers quoted that's missing from your Bible
- ✓ You suspect something's been hidden but lack framework for investigation
- ✓ You want to reclaim Jesus without the baggage of later institutional theology
- ✓ You're willing to follow truth wherever it leads—even away from 2,000 years of tradition

### **What Readers Are Saying**

*"For the first time in my life, the pieces actually fit together. Not because I'm ignoring contradictions, but because I finally understand WHY they exist."*

*"I thought questioning would destroy my faith. Instead, it gave me the Jesus I'd been searching for all along—the one who points to the Father rather than replacing him."*

*"The manuscript evidence is irrefutable. This isn't opinion or interpretation. This is documented history that changes everything."*

### **Your Next Step**

The textual evidence is waiting. The Church Father quotations are preserved. The manuscript variants are documented.

**The only question is: Are you ready to see them?**

If intellectual honesty matters to you...  
If Jesus's real message matters to you...  
If recovering what was lost matters to you...

**Then this journey is yours to take.**

The truth won't destroy what's real. It will only burn away what was added later—leaving you with something more powerful than you imagined: **Jesus's actual teaching about the Father, about himself, and about YOU.**

## GOODREADS DESCRIPTION (Combines Social Proof + Intrigue)

→ Manuscript evidence from 160 CE showing "Joseph begat Jesus"  
→ Six Church Fathers quoting verses missing from modern Bibles  
→ Baptism variants systematically erased from Scripture  
→ Political enforcement of Trinity at Council of Nicaea
