**How This Book Helps:**
- Validates their observations ("You're not crazy—those contradictions are real")
- Provides scholarly framework for understanding WHY contradictions exist
- Offers intellectual integrity without requiring faith abandonment
- Shows contradictions as CLUES rather than problems to ignore

**Emotional Payoff:** Relief, validation, intellectual honesty restored

- Gap between Jesus and believers feels insurmountable
- Teachings about human potential get dismissed: "That's fine for YOU, Jesus—you're God"

**How This Book Helps:**

- Shows Jesus's path was meant to be FOLLOWED, not just worshipped
- Recovers teachings about human divine potential through the Father
