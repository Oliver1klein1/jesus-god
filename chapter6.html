            <h1>Chapter 6 | Baptism or Birth? The Day Jesus Became Divine</h1>
            <div class="content my-8">
                <p><strong><em>At Jesus's baptism, a voice thunders from heaven ... but which words did it speak? The answer transforms Jesus from adopted Son to eternal God.</em></strong></p>
                
                <p class="drop-cap">Many differing views exist about the moon landing and whether this was staged. Imagine how <em>heated</em> those conversations would become if it transpired there are <strong>two different versions</strong> of Neil Armstrong's famous first words. One recording says, <em>"That's one small step for man, one giant leap for mankind."</em> The other says something entirely different ... words that would change how we understand that moment.</p>
                
                <p>Which version is real? Which one was <em>edited</em>?</p>
                
                <p>That's exactly what we face at the Jordan River.</p>
                <h2>The Jordan River Moment</h2>
                <p>The Jordan River, circa 30 CE. Picture it: Jesus emerges from the water, <strong>dripping and praying</strong>, when suddenly the heavens <em>tear open</em> like fabric ripping apart. A dove descends ... gentle, purposeful. And then <strong>the voice</strong>.</p>
                
                <p>That voice from heaven would echo through history, be recorded by Gospel writers, debated by Church Fathers, and ... most crucially ... <strong><em>edited by later scribes</em></strong> who needed it to say something different than it originally did.</p>
                
                <p>What exactly did the voice say?</p>

                <div class="img-card"><img src="jesus-baptized.jpg" alt="Jesus baptized at the Jordan River" class="portrait-img" /></div>
                
                <p>Your Bible probably reads: <em>"You are my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased"</em> (Luke 3:22). Safe. Affirming. Theologically comfortable.</p>
                
                <p>But tucked away in an ancient manuscript sits a <strong>radically different version</strong> ... one that would blow open our understanding of when Jesus became divine. One that early Christians heard, believed, and eventually had to <em>erase</em>.</p>
                
                <h2>The Textual Bombshell: Codex Bezae</h2>
                <p>In the Wren Library at Cambridge University ... where centuries-old manuscripts rest under climate-controlled glass like prisoners of time ... sits <strong>Codex Bezae Cantabrigiensis</strong>. Scholars call it "D." Fifth century. Greek and Latin side by side. Priceless.</p>
                
                <p>Open it to Luke's baptism account, and this is what you see:</p>
                
                <div class="scripture-card">
                    <div class="scripture-reference">Standard Text (in your Bible right now):</div>
                    <div class="scripture-text">"You are my beloved Son; with you I am well pleased."</div>
                </div>
                
                <div class="scripture-card">
                    <div class="scripture-reference">Codex Bezae (with multiple ancient witnesses):</div>
                    <div class="scripture-text"><strong><em>"You are my Son; TODAY I HAVE BEGOTTEN YOU."</em></strong></div>
                </div>
                
                <p><strong>TODAY.</strong> Not from eternity. Not before creation. <strong><em>Today</em></strong> ... at <em>this baptism</em>, at <em>this specific moment in history</em>, at <em>this precise instant when Jesus rises from the Jordan's waters</em>.</p>
                
                <p>The reason this doesn't surprise you as much as it should is because it's a <strong>direct quotation of Psalm 2:7</strong>, a messianic coronation text: <em>"You are my Son; today I have begotten you."</em> Like a king being crowned, like a president being sworn in ... there's a <strong><em>before</em></strong> and an <strong><em>after</em></strong>.</p>
                
                <p>As you can imagine, this is <em>pretty significant</em>, theologically.</p>
                
                <p>The standard text whispers: Jesus was <em>always</em> God's Son ... the baptism merely <strong>revealed</strong> an eternal reality.</p>
                
                <p>Bezae's reading shouts: Jesus <strong><em>became</em></strong> God's Son at the baptism ... <strong>adopted</strong> into divine Sonship at that transformative moment.</p>
                
                <h2>An Army of Witnesses</h2>
                <p>Now, before you dismiss Codex Bezae as some outlier manuscript written by a confused scribe with bad theology, understand this: <strong>it's not alone</strong>. Not even close.</p>
                
                <p>The same reading appears in:</p>
                <ul class="list-disc pl-8 mb-8">
                    <li>Several <strong>Old Latin manuscripts</strong> (predating most Greek copies)</li>
                    <li>Citations by <strong>multiple Church Fathers</strong>: Justin Martyr, Clement of Alexandria, Origen, Methodius, Lactantius, Hilary of Poitiers, Augustine</li>
                    <li>The <strong>Western text-type</strong> ... one of the earliest textual families</li>
                </ul>
                
                <p>That's not a fluke. That's a <strong><em>textual tradition</em></strong>.</p>
                
                <p>And Ehrman states without hedging: <em>"This is the reading that was in the <strong>original text</strong> of the Gospel."</em></p>
                
                <p>Why was it changed? Because it supported a view that later became <strong>heresy</strong>: <strong><em>adoptionism</em></strong> ... the belief that Jesus <em>became</em> God's Son at a specific moment (baptism) rather than existing eternally as divine.</p>
                
                <p>Can't have that. Too dangerous. Too limiting. Jesus needed to be divine from <em>before creation</em>, not from <em>Tuesday afternoon at the Jordan</em>.</p>
                <h2>The Paper Trail of "Today"</h2>
                <p>To prove this isn't some isolated manuscript quirk ... some rogue scribe having a bad day ... we need to follow the manuscript trail. And it's <strong><em>everywhere</em></strong>.</p>
                
                <p>Look at the <strong>New Testament itself</strong>:</p>
                
                <div class="scripture-card">
                    <div class="scripture-reference">Hebrews 1:5</div>
                    <div class="scripture-text">"For to which of the angels did God ever say, <strong><em>'You are my Son; today I have begotten you'</em></strong>?" The author explicitly applies Psalm 2:7 to Jesus. <strong>TODAY</strong>. Right there in your Bible.</div>
                </div>
                
                <div class="scripture-card">
                    <div class="scripture-reference">Acts 13:33</div>
                    <div class="scripture-text">Paul connects Jesus's <strong>resurrection</strong> with Psalm 2:7: <strong><em>"He has fulfilled this for us by raising Jesus; as it is also written in the second Psalm, 'You are My Son, today I have begotten You.'"</em></strong> Paul thought Jesus became God's Son at the <strong>resurrection</strong> ... the earliest Christology.</div>
                </div>
                
                <div class="scripture-card">
                    <div class="scripture-reference">Mark 1:11 (Western witnesses)</div>
                    <div class="scripture-text">Same alteration, same pattern: <strong><em>"You are my Son; today I have begotten you."</em></strong></div>
                </div>
                
                <p>See the pattern? The phrase <strong>"today I have begotten you"</strong> appears <em>repeatedly</em> in early Christian texts connected to Jesus ... resurrection, baptism, coronation as Messiah. It was <strong>everywhere</strong>. Until it had to disappear.</p>
                
                <h2>Justin Martyr's Testimony</h2>
                <p>Most tellingly, <strong>Justin Martyr</strong> ... writing around 150 CE, barely a century after Jesus ... preserves the baptismal declaration in his <em>Dialogue with Trypho</em>. And he's not tentative about it. He's <em>emphatic</em>:</p>
                
                <div class="scripture-card">
                    <div class="scripture-reference">Justin Martyr's Testimony (Dialogue with Trypho):</div>
                    <div class="scripture-text">"When Jesus came to the Jordan river, where John was baptizing, as Jesus descended into the water, a fire was kindled in the Jordan; and when He came out of the water, the Holy Ghost descended upon Him like a dove... For at His baptism, when He had descended into the water, a voice spoke from the heavens: <strong><em>'You are my Son; today I have begotten you.'</em></strong>"</div>
                </div>
                
                <p>Justin is <strong>crystal clear</strong>: at Jesus's baptism, God declared Jesus His Son <em>that day</em> ... not from eternity. There was a <strong>moment</strong>, a <strong>transformation</strong>, a <strong>coronation</strong>.</p>
                
                <p>This wasn't fringe theology. This was <strong>mainstream Christianity</strong> in the mid-second century ... before the theological machinery ground these inconvenient words into dust.</p>
                <h2>The Scribe's Dilemma</h2>
                <p>Now transport yourself to a fourth-century monastery scriptorium. You're a scribe—pious, careful, devoted to preserving Scripture. The manuscript on your desk contains Luke's Gospel, and you've just reached the baptism scene.</p>
                
                <p>There it is, in black ink on yellowing parchment: <em>"Today I have begotten you."</em></p>
                
                <p>Your theological training <strong>screams alarm bells</strong>. This reading suggests there was a time when Jesus <em>wasn't</em> God's Son. A <strong>before</strong> and <strong>after</strong>. A <em>moment of transformation</em>. But your bishop has been teaching ... with absolute certainty ... that the Son is <strong><em>eternally begotten</em></strong>, not begotten on a Tuesday afternoon at the Jordan.</p>
                
                <p>What do you do?</p>
                
                <p>You <strong>fix it</strong>. Not because you're malicious, but because you're <em>certain</em> this must be a scribal error from an earlier, theologically confused copyist. You swap out the problematic Psalm 2:7 quotation and replace it with safer language from <strong>Isaiah 42:1</strong>: <em>"with you I am well pleased."</em></p>
                
                <p>One phrase swapped for another. Seems innocent enough, right?</p>
                
                <p>Except this "correction" <strong><em>transforms the entire meaning</em></strong> of the baptismal moment:</p>
                
                <p><strong>Original reading:</strong> God is <em>making</em> Jesus His Son ... <strong>divine adoption</strong>, a coronation ceremony, a transformation event.</p>
                
                <p><strong>Edited reading:</strong> God is <em>affirming</em> that Jesus is His Son ... <strong>divine recognition</strong> of a pre-existing, eternal reality.</p>
                
                <p>See the sleight of hand? The baptism shifts from <strong>coronation</strong> to <strong>confirmation</strong>. From <strong>becoming</strong> to <strong>being</strong>. From <strong>event</strong> to <strong>revelation</strong>.</p>
                
                <p>This wasn't random manuscript corruption ... it was <strong><em>theological harmonization</em></strong>, deliberate alignment of the text with evolving doctrine. And it worked. The edited version eventually <strong>dominated</strong> the manuscript tradition, becoming standard across the empire.</p>
                
                <p>Yet the original reading <em>refused to die</em>. Codex Bezae preserved it. Church Fathers quoted it. Western manuscripts transmitted it. Like an ancient artifact buried under layers of sediment, it survived ... waiting to be excavated.</p>
                
                <h2>Scholarly Confirmation</h2>
                <p>Don't take my word for it. Listen to <strong>Bruce Metzger</strong> ... the godfather of New Testament textual criticism, a scholar so respected that his <em>Textual Commentary on the Greek New Testament</em> is considered the gold standard. He writes:</p>
                
                <div class="scripture-card">
                    <div class="scripture-reference">Bruce Metzger's Scholarly Assessment:</div>
                    <div class="scripture-text">"The Western reading, <strong><em>'You are my Son, today I have begotten you,'</em></strong> which derives from Psalm 2:7, was either altered in the Alexandrian and Byzantine traditions to the present text of Luke, perhaps <strong>in order to prevent misunderstanding of Jesus' divine sonship in adoptionistic terms</strong>, or was introduced by Western scribes who recalled Ps 2:7."</div>

                <p>Notice Metzger's careful scholarly language ... he presents <em>both</em> possibilities. But then he admits the former is <strong>more likely</strong>: the original Psalm quotation was <em>changed</em> to avoid adoptionism.</p>
                
                <p>Translation? <strong>They edited it.</strong> Deliberately. Theologically. To make the text say what they <em>needed</em> it to say rather than what it <em>originally</em> said.</p>
                <h2>The Telling Oversight in Acts</h2>
                <p>But wait ... it gets better. <em>Much</em> better.</p>
                
                <p>While the editors successfully scrubbed <strong>"Today I have begotten you"</strong> from the baptism scene in Luke 3:22, they <strong><em>forgot to check Acts</em></strong>. Remember our criminal who cleaned the doorknob but forgot about the window?</p>
                
                <p>There it sits, <strong>hiding in plain sight</strong> in Acts 13:33:</p>
                
                <div class="scripture-card">
                    <div class="scripture-reference">Acts 13:33 (The Smoking Gun):</div>
                    <div class="scripture-text">"God has fulfilled this for us by <strong>raising up Jesus</strong>. As it is also written in the second Psalm: <strong><em>'You are My Son, today I have begotten You.'</em></strong>"</div>
                </div>
                
                <p>Luke ... or whoever wrote Acts ... connects Psalm 2:7 directly to Jesus's <strong>resurrection</strong>. Not his baptism. Even <em>later</em>. This preserves what we identified in Chapter 4 as <strong>Exaltation Christology</strong> ... the earliest Christian belief that Jesus became God's Son when God <em>raised him from the dead</em>.</p>
                
                <p>This is the <strong>original Christian proclamation</strong> ... you can hear it echoing through the early sermons in Acts. Jesus was a man, anointed by God, crucified, and <em>then</em> ... <strong>only then</strong> ... exalted to divine Sonship.</p>
                
                <p>Like the Father-Creator language surviving in Acts 4:24, this theological fossil <em>escaped editorial standardization</em>. Maybe Acts seemed less dangerous. Maybe the editors were exhausted by the time they got to it. Maybe they just <strong>missed it</strong>.</p>
                
                <p>Whatever the reason, the testimony survived ... like a fingerprint on a glass that nobody wiped.</p>
                
                <h2>Voices That Refused Silence</h2>
                <p>Even as the standardized text spread throughout the empire, <strong>early Christian witnesses</strong> kept quoting the original. Like voices crying out from the past, refusing to be drowned out by theological revisionism.</p>
                
                <p><strong>Tertullian</strong>, writing around 200 CE, states it with breathtaking clarity:</p>
                
                <div class="scripture-card">
                    <div class="scripture-reference">Tertullian's Clear Statement (c. 200 CE):</div>
                    <div class="scripture-text">"We have believed Jesus Christ to be the Son of God and judge, <strong><em>begotten of God the Father at the river Jordan</em></strong> by a transfer of the Holy Spirit upon Him."</div>
                </div>
                
                <p>Read that carefully. Tertullian ... one of early Christianity's most influential theologians ... believed Jesus <strong><em>became</em></strong> God's Son <strong>at the Jordan River</strong>. Not in eternity. Not at his birth. <strong><em>At the baptism</em></strong>.</p>
                
                <p>Church Fathers like Augustine acknowledged <em>both</em> variants existed, though they increasingly preferred the non-adoptionistic reading. The theological tide was turning. The original understanding was being swept out to sea.</p>
                
                <p>But these testimonies remain ... stubborn, inconvenient, <strong>undeniable</strong> ... preserving an earlier Christianity where Jesus's divine status had a <strong>beginning point</strong> at the Jordan River.</p>
                
                <h2>The Pattern We Keep Finding</h2>
                <p>By now, you should be seeing it. The <strong>same editorial fingerprints</strong> everywhere:</p>
                
                <div class="scripture-card">
                    <div class="scripture-reference">The Editorial Pattern</div>
                    <div class="scripture-text">
                        <strong>Original text:</strong> Jesus becomes divine at a specific moment (baptism)<br><br>
                        <strong>Theological problem:</strong> This contradicts emerging belief in Jesus's eternal divine status<br><br>
                        <strong>Editorial solution:</strong> Change the divine declaration to remove the time element (<strong>"today"</strong>)<br><br>
                        <strong>End result:</strong> The text now supports eternal Sonship rather than adoption
                    </div>
                </div>
                
                <p>It's the same playbook we've been tracking through the Father-Creator deletions, through the "good teacher" variants, through every textual alteration we've examined. <strong><em>Jesus's subordination to the Father gets progressively erased</em></strong>, replaced with language that elevates him to co-equal status.</p>
                
                <p>The edited text serves developing <strong>Trinitarian theology</strong>, where the Son is <em>eternally begotten</em> ... not created, not adopted, not crowned at a moment in time. By replacing <strong>"Today I have begotten you"</strong> with the innocuous <strong>"with you I am well pleased,"</strong> scribes <em>eliminated textual support</em> for the earliest Christian understanding of Jesus.</p>
                
                <p>Mission accomplished. Readings standardized. Theology unified.</p>
                
                <p>Except the voice at the Jordan <em>still echoes</em> faintly through Codex Bezae, through Western manuscripts, through patristic quotations: <strong><em>"Today I have begotten you"</em></strong> ... a declaration that refuses to be silenced, no matter how many scribes tried to erase it.</p>
                
                <p>As we turn to Chapter 7, we'll watch how <strong>genealogical manipulations</strong> served similar theological purposes ... how Jesus's family tree got <em>pruned, grafted, and rearranged</em> to connect him to David while somehow accommodating the emerging virgin birth doctrine. The pattern continues. The textual trail deepens. And the case against theological revisionism grows <strong><em>stronger with every chapter</em></strong>.</p>

                        <li>At Jesus's baptism, the earliest manuscripts (including Codex Bezae and multiple Church Fathers) read: "You are my Son; today I have begotten you" ... a direct quote from Psalm 2:7</li>
                        <li>Later manuscripts changed this to the safer "You are my beloved Son; with you I am well pleased"—eliminating the explosive implication that Jesus became God's Son at that moment</li>
                        <li>Acts 13:33 preserves the original theology: Psalm 2:7 applied to Jesus's resurrection (even earlier than baptism)</li>
                        <li>This represents Adoption/Exaltation Christology—the earliest Christian belief that Jesus became divine at a specific moment, not eternally</li>
